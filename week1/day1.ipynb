Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

      "How well do you really know her?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bro, let’s kick off this week with a simple but serious question: how well do you really know your partner?\n",
      "I’m not talking about knowing her favorite color or how she takes her coffee. I mean the deeper stuff. What goes through her mind before she falls asleep? What dreams has she not yet fulfilled? What is she afraid of?\n",
      "\n",
      "Relationship researcher Dr. John Gottman found that one of the biggest differences between couples who stay together for years and those who don’t is how well they know each other’s inner world. Happy couples don’t just know what their partner did today, they know how they felt, what’s worrying them, and what truly matters most in their life. They go beyond just talking about kids or work—they dig deeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the question is—how do we build that? How do we make sure we really know our partner, even after years together?\n",

      "Take 5 minutes alone and answer the following questions—not by asking her, but based on what you think:\n",

      "\n",
      "Bonus step: Let her ask you the same questions.\n",
      "You’ll be surprised how much new stuff comes out—and you might also notice some gaps in your “love map” of her that you didn’t even realize existed.\n",

      "Go for it. See you tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Week 2 Day 2\n",

      "\n",
      "Bro, when was the last time you sat down with your partner and really talked about the future?\n",
      "Not which grocery store to go to this week, not the kids’ extracurriculars—but how she imagines your life together in 5, 10, or 20 years?\n",
      "\n",
      "John Gottman’s research shows that couples who regularly talk about the future and develop a shared vision feel more connected. The dreams don’t have to be identical—each person can want slightly different things—but simply knowing each other’s direction helps you feel like you’re heading there together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here’s the thing—we often assume we know how our partner sees the future, when in reality her vision may have changed. Maybe she once dreamed of one career and now wants something else. Maybe she has fantasies she hasn’t shared because she didn’t think they were “relevant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Your task for today:\n",
      "\n",

      "Try to find points where your visions align.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn’t about making concrete plans—it’s about understanding how she envisions your shared life. You might learn something surprising. You might even look at your own dreams differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "And remember—this isn’t a one-time exercise. People change. Life changes. What you thought five years ago may not hold today. Give it space. Be curious. Stay open.\n",

      "What little things make her happy?\n",

      "\n",
      "Maybe it’s a morning text, making her coffee just right, or a random hug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it’s watching a sunset, hearing a certain song, or reading a good book.\n",
      "\n",

      "At the end of the day, love is built on small things, not just grand gestures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Week 2 Day 4\n",
      "What are her stresses and worries?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bro, let’s be real—how many times has she been quiet, tense, or stressed, and you had no idea why? Maybe you asked, and she said, “I don’t feel like talking,” or “I’m fine,” but deep down, you knew something was off.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most important things in a relationship is understanding what stresses your partner—not just in crisis moments, but in daily life. When you know what’s weighing on her, you can not only be there for her, but help reduce her emotional load. And that is a relationship superpower.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does the research say?\n",
      "Gottman found that couples who understand each other’s stress sources develop more empathy and strengthen their bond over time. Because when you know what’s bothering her, you’re not just reacting—you’re creating a safe space where she feels comfortable opening up.\n",

      "You don’t need to save the world—just show her you see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her worries aren’t just hers—they’re yours as a couple. When she feels you’re in it with her, she’ll feel more secure, more loved, and more connected to you.\n",

      "Week 2 Day 5\n",
      "Who are the important people in her life?\n",
      "\n",
      "Think for a second—if I asked you right now who her closest friends are, not including you or family, would you know? Who’s her best friend? Who does she turn to for advice? Who’s the first person she texts when something exciting happens?\n",
      "\n",
      "Strong relationships don’t happen in a vacuum. Your partner has a whole social world that gives her strength, support, and space to process things—even things she doesn’t always tell you right away. The more you understand the people around her, the better you’ll understand her—and your place in her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does the research say?\n",
      "Gottman found that couples who know and respect each other’s support networks build more stable relationships. Why? Because when you know the people important to her, you’re not asking her to choose between you and them. Instead, you become part of the system that uplifts her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your task for today:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ask her gently about the people in her life:\n",

      "What are her dreams and aspirations?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pause for a moment—what’s your partner’s biggest dream?\n",
      "It doesn’t have to be something grand like “saving the world” or “opening a jungle restaurant.” It might be something personal—writing a book, learning a new field, traveling solo, or just becoming a better version of herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "How much do you really know about it?\n",
      "\n",
      "What does the research say?\n",
      "Gottman found that one major factor separating long-lasting couples from those who drift apart is how well they know and support each other’s dreams. Couples who don’t talk about aspirations tend to face more conflict and distance. On the other hand, when you do know her dreams—and even help her move toward them—she feels truly seen by you.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Show you support her.\n",
      "\n",
      "You don’t have to become her life coach, but you can ask:\n",
      "“How can I help you move toward that?”\n",
      "“What’s the smallest step you could take in that direction?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, just knowing that someone sees your dream and believes in it—that’s enough to give you the strength to pursue it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it this way—when you show her that you see her dreams, you’re saying without words: “I see you. I’m with you. I want you to succeed.” Few things strengthen love more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Week 2 Day 7\n",
      "Creating a Shared Relationship Vision\n",
      "\n",
      "Research in positive psychology and relationships shows that couples who share a common vision for their future experience higher levels of satisfaction, intimacy, and stability. Dr. John Gottman explains that when couples create a “road map” for their future together, it gives their relationship deeper meaning, improves cooperation, and enhances their ability to face challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relationships without open conversations about the future risk drifting apart, as partners' goals and dreams diverge. That’s why investing in a shared vision isn’t just a “romantic exercise”—it’s a practical tool to identify mutual goals, bridge gaps, and grow together.\n",
      "\n",
      "So bro, you made it to the last day of this week—well done! You’ve had meaningful conversations with your partner, gained a clearer picture of who she is and what matters to her. Now it’s time to look ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take a moment to ask yourself: how do you see yourself and your relationship in 5, 10, or 20 years? Where will you live? What will your lives look like? Are you spending a lot of time together, or are you each wrapped up in your own world? Do you have shared dreams? Maybe to travel, build a business together, or retire early by the sea?\n",

      "\n",
      "Your task for today:\n",
      "Sit down with your partner and have an open conversation about your shared vision. It doesn’t have to be heavy—do it over a glass of wine or while taking a walk. Let her share how she envisions your future, and share your perspective too.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to make it more concrete, write a list together of 5–10 things you want to achieve as a couple in the coming years. These can range from small experiences, like traveling somewhere specific, to major life goals, like moving or changing your lifestyle.\n",
