Week 2 Day 1
Building Your Partner’s “Love Map”
How well do you really know her?

Bro, let’s start this week with a simple but serious question: How well do 
you really know your partner?
I’m not talking about knowing her favorite color or how she likes her 
coffee. I mean the deeper stuff.
What goes through her mind before she falls asleep? What dreams has she 
yet to fulfill? What scares her?

Relationship researcher Dr. John Gottman found that one of the biggest 
differences between couples who last and those who don’t is how well they 
know each other's inner world.
Happy couples don’t just know what their partner did today — they know how 
they felt, what’s bothering them, and what truly matters to them in life.
They don’t just talk about the kids or work — they dive deeper.

So the real question is: How do you build that? How do you make sure you 
really know your partner even after years together?

Your task for today:

Today, you're going to check how well you really know her.

Sit down by yourself for 5 minutes and answer the following questions — 
without checking with her, just based on what you believe:

What’s been bothering her most recently?

What’s her ultimate life dream?

If she could change one thing about herself, what would it be?

What’s been the most meaningful moment in her life so far?

Who has influenced her the most?

After answering, check with her:

Tell her: “I did a little experiment and answered a few questions about 
you — I’m curious to see if I got them right.”

Let her answer the same questions and compare them to your answers.

Bonus step? Let her ask you the same questions.
You’ll probably be surprised at what comes up — and you might also see 
where there are gaps in your “love map” of her.
Things you assumed you knew... might not be quite right.
Go for it. See you tomorrow.

Week 2 Day 2
How does she see the future?

Bro, when was the last time you really sat down with your partner and 
talked about the future?
Not which grocery store to go to this week, or what class the kids are 
taking — but how she envisions your life 5, 10, or 20 years from now?

John Gottman’s research shows that couples who regularly talk about the 
future and develop a shared vision feel much more connected.
It doesn’t have to be the exact same dream — each of you can want slightly 
different things — but just knowing where each of you is heading helps you 
feel like you’re moving in the same direction.

But here’s the thing:
We often assume we know how our partner sees the future, but her vision 
might have changed.
Maybe she used to dream about one career path but now wants something 
else.
Or maybe she’s been fantasizing about something she never mentioned 
because it didn’t seem “relevant.”

Your task for today:

At some point during the day, plan a quiet moment where you can ask her 
one or more of these questions:

“If you could imagine our life 10 years from now, what would it look 
like?”

“Is there something you’ve always wanted to do but haven’t done yet?”

“What’s one change you’d love to see in our lives in the future?”

Let her talk.

Don’t interrupt.

Don’t rush to explain how it does or doesn’t fit into your plans.

Just listen.

At the end of the conversation, share your vision too.

Tell her how you see the future.

Try to find common ground — places where your dreams align.

The goal here isn’t to make a practical plan. It’s just to understand how 
she sees your life together going forward.
You might learn things you never knew, and it might even make you reflect 
on your own goals differently.

And remember — this isn’t a one-time thing.
People change, life changes, and what you both wanted five years ago might 
not apply anymore.
Make space for that. Stay curious. Be open to hearing it.
