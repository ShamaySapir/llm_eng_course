A magical, colorful illustration in the style of a whimsical animated children's TV show.
A large, sparkling golden gate stands closed in the background, partially hidden behind trees, with a small friendly sign hanging from it.
In front of the gate stand four characters:
— a curly-haired 3-year-old boy with bright brown eyes and light green-blue clothes with dinosaur prints. He holds a small turquoise water bottle and smiles playfully.
— a puppy, a small white dog with a gray spot around one eye and floppy ears, wagging his tail energetically.
— a teddy bear, a small light-brown bear with big round black eyes, a sweet smile, a yellow scarf, and a tiny backpack with fun stickers.
— a whale, a large friendly blue whale with white spots, a huge warm smile, and shiny wise eyes, rising from behind as if helping the group.
The image has an open area (like grass or sky) for inserting story text.
